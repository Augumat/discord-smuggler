# Summary
A simple application that can be used to send and receive files larger than Discord's 50 Megabyte maximum upload size.  (Lossless!)

# Usage
Simply put the file you want to unwrap or the collection of files you want to reassemble into the input folder and then run the relevant batch script in the main folder.

The original file(s) **WILL BE DELETED** and replaced with the newly converted file(s).

After that you're good to go!
